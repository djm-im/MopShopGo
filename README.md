# MopShopGo

MoP Shop implementation in GoLang.

### Important notes and assumptions

Before starting this project, it is needed to run the MySQL container.

For testing open Postman and import endpoints.

**Assumptions**

* Endless supply of products. That means no limit on the number of products.
* The project contains hard-coded values for path variables and passwords.  
  This style is terrible for leas two reasonsâ€”the first, security.  
  The second reason, it is not flexible and configurable.  
  This trade-off was made for the sake of faster development.
* The field `Product.Name` is chosen to be a unique value.  
  However, a better approach is to have a product code and set it as a unique value.  
  This trade-off is made because of simplicity.
* Better logging - more details.

**Improvements**

* Database migration tool (like Java FlywayDb)
* Add search of products by different fields

#### Build and run the project

```bash
 go get .
 go build
 go test
 go run main.go
```
