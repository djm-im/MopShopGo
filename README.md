# MopShopGo

MoP Shop implementation in GoLang.

Important Note: I don't have a prio
### Important notes and assumptions

Before starting this project, it is needed to run the MySQL container.

For testing open Postman and import endpoints.

**Assumptions**

* Endless supply of products. That means no limit on the number of products.
* The project contains hard-coded values for path variables and passwords.  
  This style is terrible for leas two reasonsâ€”the first, security.  
  The second reason, it is not flexible and configurable.  
  This trade-off was made for the sake of faster development.
* The field `Product.Name` is chosen to be a unique value.  
  However, a better approach is to have a product code and set it as a unique value.  
  This trade-off is made because of simplicity.

**Improvements**

* Database migration tool (like Java FlywayDb)
* Add search of products by different fields
* Add roles for users - Admin and User (customer)
* Better logging - more log messages, and more details.
* Add SwaggerUI for endpoints 
* Split "Service layer" (`*Service.go` files) - it's a combination of Controller and Service layer.

#### Build and run the project

```bash
 go get .
 go build
 go test
 go run main.go
```

### Backlog (Todo list)

- [ ] User login
- [ ] Postman export - collection and environment variables to a repository
- [ ] User creates a new cart
- [ ] Add admin for create, delete, and update products
- [ ] Admin/Products delete
- [ ] Admin/Products update
- [ ] Admin/Products enable image upload
- [ ] Products, add a new product - price have to be greater than zero
- [ ] Admin/Products when insert a new product chek is name a unique value (currently returns
  MySQL `Error 1062: Duplicate entry`)
- [ ] Add MySql Docker container
- [ ] Add link to MySql container repository
- [ ] Add tests (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] Move the project into a Docker container
